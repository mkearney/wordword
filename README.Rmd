# wordword

>  =â‰  A simple little thesaurus package.

## Installation

You can install the released version of wordword from [Github](https://github.com) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("mkearney/wordword")
```

## thesaurus.com

## `wordword::tuna()`

Access the unofficial API behind thesaurus.com:

```{r tuna}
wordword::tuna("intimate") %>%
  print(n = 30)
```

## bighugelabs.com

There's also access to bighugelab's words API (requires API key), but I ran 
through the limit on free requests in no time.

## `wordword::sameword()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wordword::sameword("intimate")
```

## `wordword::diffword()`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
wordword::diffword("intimate")
```
